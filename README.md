# ParticleCubeSimulation
A Python script utilizing Pygame and OpenGL to create a dynamic 3D simulation with a rotating cube and interacting particles featuring collision detection and response, causing particles to exchange velocities upon impact within the cube boundaries.

I have attatched the project demonstration herewith.
